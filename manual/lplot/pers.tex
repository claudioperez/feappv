All subsequent plots are to be drawn in a three dimesional perspective view.
A plot may also be in a cartesian two dimensional view
(see {\tt CART}esian plot manual).  The default plot mode is cartesian.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l }
 inew & 0 for input of new parameters \\
 inew & 1 for use of old parameters
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

If new parameters are to be specified input:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l }
 vx & x-coordinate of view point \\
 vy & y-coordinate of view point \\
 vz & z-coordinate of view point
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
and
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l }
 ex & x-component of vertical vector \\
 ey & y-component of vertical vector \\
 ez & z-component of vertical vector
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The view point and a target point computed at the center of
the body establish the view direction; the vertical vector
for the screen establishes the orientation of the body with
respect to the view direction

In batch mode, the quantities {\tt inew}, etc. must appear
after the command language {\tt END} command and ordered so that reads are
performed at the execution of the correct instruction.
In interactive mode prompts will be given for each input item.
