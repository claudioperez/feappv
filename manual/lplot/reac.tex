Plot nodal reactions for current solution state.  The
maximum length will be automatically scaled.  All other
reactions will be scaled in proportion to the maximum, accordingly
some very small values may scale to be too small to be
visible.  If {\tt n2} is non-zero the vector tip will appear next
to the node; whereas, if {\tt n2} is zero the tail of the load
vectors are on the nodes.
