\chapter[Plot Manual]{Plot Manual Pages}

{\sl FEAPpv} has several options which may be used to display results
on a graphics screen or to prepare PostScript files for later printing
in documents.  The following
pages summarize the commands which are available to plot specific results.
Commands exist to plot results for one to three dimensional problems.
Three dimensional results are best displayed using a perspective view and
hidden surface removal methods.  Very simple schemes are used and anomalies
can exist due to the order in which surface facets are sorted.  Results
can also be saved and displayed using other display tools.
