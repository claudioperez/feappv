Plot nodal generalized displacements as vectors at
each node.  Vector lengths will be scaled in proportion to
the maximum displacement, accordingly some vectors may be
too small to be visible.  If {\tt n2} is nonzero the vector tip
will appear next to the node; whereas, if {\tt n2} is zero the
tail of the load vectors are on the nodes.  Default: n2 = 0.
