Plot information related to eigenvector {\tt n1} (an eigensolution
must be performed (see {\tt SUBS}pace command in Appendix B).
before attempting an eigenvector plot.  The plot mode must also be
set as {\tt DEFO}rmed.

If {\tt n3} is zero a deformed plot for the superposed eigenvector
will be given.

If {\tt n3} is nonzero contours for the {\tt n3} degree of
freedom for eigenvector {\tt n1} will be constructed according
to the value specified in {\tt n2}.

For {\tt n2} positive, {\tt n2} contour values will be constructed.
The values for each contour must be specified
after the command language program for batch execution or at
the prompt for interactive execution.  Eight values per
record are input.  The number for the first contour is
specified on the record (or prompt) immediately following
the values.

For {\tt n2} non-positive, a fill-type plot will be constructed.
The maximum and minimum value of the quantity to
be plotted must be given.  The program will compute equally
spaced intervals between these values for the plot.  Alternatively
a blank record may be input and the program will
select values to be plotted based on maximum and minimum values of
the component.
