The {\tt HIDE} command is used to compute the surface
facets for a three dimensional solid region.  Subsequent
plots are then given on the surface facets only.  A pseudo
hidden surface routine is accomplished by sorting the facets
and plotting from the one most distant from the viewer to
the one closest.

If {\tt n1} is {\tt -1} the outline of facets is white; if {\tt n1}
is less than {\tt -1} the outline is black (and invisible on the screen).
If {\tt n2} is non-zero then all boundary facets are plotted.
If {\tt n3} is positive the color is set to n3.
