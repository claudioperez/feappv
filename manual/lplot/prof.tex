\index{Plot!PROFile}
This command displays a view of the profile for the tangent matrix.
If the parameter \texttt{v1} is zero only the upper half is shown;
whereas for non-zero values both sides are displayed.  Using before and
after a profile optimization command (see solution command \texttt{OPTImize})
provides a view of the effectiveness of each solution mode.
Should be used only in a cartesian view (See command \texttt{CARTesian}).
