The values of \texttt{v1} and \texttt{v2} are used to set the plot
range for the next plot.  The range of the plot will be set so that
\texttt{rangemin = min(v1,v2)} and \texttt{rangemax = max(v1,v2)}.
The values will be used until the range is reset or turned off.  In
interactive mode the range may be turned off using the command
\texttt{rang,off}.  In batch mode the command \texttt{NORAnge} must
be used.  The default is range \texttt{off}.
