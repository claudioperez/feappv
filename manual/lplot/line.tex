The {\tt LINE} command may be used to set the line type.
This command only affects PostScript outputs.
The line type is assigned by the value of {\tt n1} as:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l }
 Number & Line Type \\ \hline
   0 &  solid \\
   1 &  dotted \\
   2 &  dash-dot \\
   3 &  short dash \\
   4 &  long dash \\
   5 &  dot-dot-dash \\
   6 &  short dash-long dash \\
   7 &  wide dash
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

The width of the line is set using {\tt v1} which may have values
between 0.0 and 2.0 (normal is 1.0).
