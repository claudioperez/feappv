The {\tt MESH} command causes a display of the current view of the 
mesh to be displayed in a line (wire-frame) mode. A surface mesh may also
be displayed using the {\tt FILL} command (N.B.  For 3-d problems it is
necessary to use a perspective view and the {\tt HIDE} option for fill
views to function correctly).
