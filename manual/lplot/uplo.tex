The {\tt UPLOt} command depends on options added  by users.  To make this
command operational it is necessary to write a user subprogram
\begin{verbatim}
      SUBROUTINE UPLOT(CT)

      IMPLICIT   NONE

      REAL*8     CT(3)

C     Users to add plot commands here

      END
\end{verbatim}
and compile with the main program and archives.

See \textsl{FEAP} Programmers Manual for more information on writing the subprogram.
