The {\tt CENT}er command is used to place the center at a specific
location on the screen.  The input values of {\tt x} and {\tt y} locate
the center of the plot in terms of normalized screen coordinates.  The
plot region covers approximately the area bounded by
0 $<$  x , 1.4 and 0 $<$ y $<$ 1.0.
