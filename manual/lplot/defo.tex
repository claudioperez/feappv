This command sets the plot options to be associated
with a deformed mesh with the displacements scaled by the
\texttt{v1} value (default: v1 = 1). If any part of an element in
the deformed mesh leaves the plot region, it will not
appear in the plot.

Specification of a nonzero \texttt{n2} value retains the plot
scaling at a previously set \texttt{v1} value.  This permits superpostion
of undeformed or previous solutions on the current
plot for comparison purposes.

The parameter \texttt{v2} is used to scale eigenvectors.  By default all
eigenvectors are unscaled.  The program attempts to scale eigenvectors for 
plotting such that the maximum component is unity.  Thus, the scaling should
compare the mesh dimensions such that a reasonable shape is obtained.

An undeformed option is specified using the \texttt{UNDE}formed command.
