The frame is changed to {\tt n1} and the region is cleared.
The permissible values for {\tt n1} are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c | l }
 n1  & Region used \\ \hline
  0  & Entire window used \\
  1  & Upper left quadrant \\
  2  & Upper right quadrant \\
  3  & Lower left  quadrant \\
  4  & Lower right quadrant \\
     & (Default: n1 = 0)
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Some graphics terminals do not support the feature of erasing
only part of the screen; in these cases the entire
screen may be erased instead of only the part specified.
