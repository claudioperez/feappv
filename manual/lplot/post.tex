The {\tt POST}Script command will enable the output of a
postscript file for later use in producing hard copy plots.
The sequence is initiated by the first {\tt POST}Script command (a
non-zero {\tt n1} is in landscape mode, a zero value is in portrait mode).
The name of the file
containing the output is {\tt feapX.eps} (where X is between
{\tt a} and {\tt z}) and appears on the text screen.  Subsequent
commands will produce plots which appear on the screen and will also
send information to the output file.  A second {\tt POST}Script command
closes the output file and subsequent commands will
give plots only on the screen.

Up to 26 PostScript output files may be produced during
a work session.  The program checks for existence of a file
before the open operation.  Files must be purged by the user
outside a FEAPpv execution session.  Note that PostScript
files can be quite large and disk quotas can easily be
exceeded.

If {\tt n2} is non-zero the {\sl FEAPpv} logo is printed in the
PostScript file by commands that cause it to be printed on
the screen (e.g., {\tt WIPE}).  Default: n2 = 0.
