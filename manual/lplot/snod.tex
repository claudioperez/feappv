The {\tt SNODE} command displays the position of super nodes used
for blending mesh constructions.  If {\tt n1}
is negative, only the node position is shown, if {\tt n1} is positive the
node numbers with the values between {\tt n1} and {\tt n2} are
placed near the node position;
if {\tt n1} is zero, numbers are placed near the position of all super nodes.
