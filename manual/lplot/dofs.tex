This command allows one to reorder or turn off the degree of
freedoms for plotting purposes.  {\tt n1} becomes the first
degree of freedom, {\tt n2} becomes the second degree of freedom,
and {\tt n3} becomes the third degree of freedom.  Entering
a zero for any degree of freedom turns off that degree of
freedom when plotting deformed shapes.  By default, plotting
is done with all degrees of freedom turned on and in their
logical order (dofs,1,2,3).
