\headb

This command will set the plot options to be associated
with a undeformed mesh.

Specification of a non-zero {\tt n2} value retains the plot
scaling to a previously set value.  This permits superpostion
of deformed solutions on the current plot for comparison purposes.

A deformed option is specified using the {\tt DEFO}rm command.
