\heada{SOLUTION}{QUIT}
\hspace{1.0cm}{{quit \hfill}}
\headb

The last solution command may be {\tt QUIT},  or  just {\tt Q}.
This  terminates the command language solution and returns the program
to perform  additional
tasks on the same data, modify data, enter a new problem, or {\tt STOP}
execution.  The {\tt QUIT} command causes termination of execution
without writing the restart files (they remain the same as
at the beginning of execution if they existed).
