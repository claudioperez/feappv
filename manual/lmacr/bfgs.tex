The {\tt BFGS} command computes a solution using a quasi-Newton
method with BFGS (Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shano)
updates.  The command must be called at the beginning of an
analysis - prior to the computation of any solutions with a
tangent matrix.  It is intended for use on problems with
symmetric tangents.  \textsl{FEAPpv} computes a new tangent at the
beginning of each time step.  Subsequently, the program will
compute up to {\tt nits} updates before computing another
tangent (default nits=15). The value of {\tt stol} is used in
connection with a line search algorithm to compute a new
solution (default stol=0.8). And {\tt etol} is the BFGS energy
tolerance (default etol=tol).

A typical algorithm using BFGS is:

\begin{verbatim}
       LOOP,,N
         TANG
         BFGS,,10,0.8,1.d-10
       NEXT
\end{verbatim}

In the above a tangent will be computed and factored.  BFGS
would then perform 10 iterations, use line search on any
step in which the energy was greater than 0.8 times a previous
maximum, and exit when the energy is less than 1.d-10
times the initial energy in the step.
