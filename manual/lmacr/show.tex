The use of the {\tt SHOW} command will display the current
solution status for the problem.  Values include the {\tt time},
{\tt dt}, {\tt tol}, {\tt prop}, Maximum energy in step, current energy
in step, augmented factor, and command print status
(T=on; F=off).

The {\tt SHOW,DICT} command will produce a table of the
current arrays allocated together with their first word
address, lengths, precisions, and remaining memory.  All
arrays are allocated out of a blank common whose length is
assigned in the main routine {\tt program feap}.  The length
also appears at the initiation of execution.

The {\tt SHOW,name,n1,n2} option (where {\it name} is the array name
displayed using the {\tt SHOW,DICT} command) outputs the current
values of the {\tt name} array entries between {\tt n1} and {\tt n2}.
If the range entries are both zero (omitted), the entire array is
output.

The {\tt SHOW,ELEM}ent provides a one-line description of the
currently loaded user elements.
