The {\tt DT} solution command specifies the value of the time
step for time dependent problems (i.e., transient or quasi-
static problems).  The value of {\tt v1} indicates the time step
to be used and should be greater or equal to zero.  Generally,
it is necessary to use a {\tt TIME} solution command, in
conjunction with the {\tt DT} command, to advance the time and
compute proportional loading values if necessary.
