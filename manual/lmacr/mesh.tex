The use of the {\tt MESH} command permits the redefinition
of the mesh data.  Nodal forces may be
redefined during solution to consider additional
loading distributions.  In addition, nodal coordinates,
values of temperatures, angles of sloping boundaries, constants,
material set numbers for elements, and material properties
ties may be redefined.  It is also permitted to change the
boundary restraint codes or the element connection data provided {\sl FEAP}
is solving problems in a {\tt CHAN}ge mode.
