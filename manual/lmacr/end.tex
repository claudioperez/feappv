\heada{SOLUTION}{END}

\headb

The last batch command must be {\tt END} or {\tt QUIT}.
This terminates the current execution sequence and returns the program
the main driver, which may then perform additional
solution tasks on the same data, modify the data,
enter a new problem, or {\tt STOP} execution.
The use of {\tt END} causes a restart file to be
updated for subsequent resumptions of execution with the
current status preserved.

Immediately following the end command any data
required by statements in the {\it command language program} should appear
when a batch execution is performed.

Additional solution steps may be performed by including additional
{\tt BATC}h-{\tt END} or {\tt INTE}ractive-{\tt END} pairs.
