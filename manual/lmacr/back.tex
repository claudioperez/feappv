\headb

The use of the {\tt BACK} command will decrement the
current time by {\tt dt}, the current time increment.  In addition,
the previous value of the proportional loading will be
recomputed, if necessary.  The value of the current time and
proportional loading are reported in the output (or to the
screen).  The back command also will recompute the dynamic
state at the old time for time integration of the equations
of motion, as well as, restore the stress data base for any
elements with non-linear constitutive equations which
require variables other than the displacement state to compute a solution.

As an option, it is possible to specify a new time
increment for integrations to be continued. The value of
{\tt dtnew} is then used to perform the updates on the solutions
in the same way as if the command {\tt DT,,dtnew} were given.
See manual on {\tt DT} command for additional details.
