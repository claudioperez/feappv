The {\tt IDEN}titiy command is used to specify an identity
matrix.  In general it may be used in conjunction with an
eigen computation to compute the eigenpairs of a stiffness
matrix.  When {\tt n1} and {\tt n2} are specified they indicate the
node range (i.e., {\tt n1} to {\tt n2}) for which the identity
matrix is to be specified.  When used in this mode all boundary
restraints must be omitted and a shift used to compute any zero eigenvalues.
