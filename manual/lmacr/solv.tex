The command {\tt SOLV}e is used to specify when the
equations generated by a {\tt FORM} are to be solved.  In {\sl FEAPpv},
a direct solution of the equations is performed using a profile
storage with a variable band (active column) method of
solution or by an iterative method depending on which solution scheme has
been specified by the user.

In the solution of some nonlinear problems it is possible
to obtain convergence for a wider range of loading and
time step size using a "line search".  The line search may
be requested by placing {\tt LINE} in the second field of the
solve command.  The parameter {\tt v1} is the required
energy reduction to preclude a line search being performed
(if the current energy is larger than {\tt v1} times the minimum
energy in the step so far, a line search is performed).  If
not specified {\tt v1} defaults to 0.8 (recommended values are
between 0.6 and 0.9).  Line search should never be used in a
linear problem since extra evaluations of the residual are
required during the line search.
