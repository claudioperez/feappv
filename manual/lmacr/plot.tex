In {\sl FEAPpv}, screen and hard copy PostScript plots may
be made for several quantities of interest.

A {\tt PLOT} may be specified to initiate interactive
graphics outputs.  After entering graphics mode a prompt
will be displayed.  At this time, {\tt quantity} and the {\tt n1},
{\tt n2}, and {\tt n3} values may be specified.
Alternatively, a
{\tt PLOT,quantity,n1,n2,n3} command also may be issued while in
interactive execution mode (this is the only option for batch executions).

See the PLOT Appendix for admissible values of {\tt quantity} and parameters.
