The command {\tt AUGM}ent is used to perform augmented
lagrangian updates to solutions.  Each element computes an
update to the augmented data (defined in a user
element) using {\tt isw} equal to 10.

Augmented Lagrangian updates are normally used to accurately
satisfy constraints (e.g., incompressibility) during a solution.
