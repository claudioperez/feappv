The {\tt WRIT}e command may be used to save the
current values of displacements and nodal stresses for subsequent use.
This option is particularly useful for saving
states which are to be plotted later.  It is not intended as
a restart option (see {\tt REST}art for restarting a previously
saved problem state).

The values of {\tt xxxx} are used to specify the file  name
(4-characters  only),  manipulate  the  file,  and write out
states.  The values permitted are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l l l}
 xxxx =& wind & rewind current output file. \\
 xxxx =& clos & close current output file. \\
 xxxx =& disp & write current displacement state onto the \\
       &      & current file. \\
 xxxx =& stre & write current nodal stress state onto the \\
       &      & current file. \\
 xxxx =& ???? & anything else is used to set current filename. \\
       &      & Only four characters are permitted and only one \\
       &      & file may be opened at any time.  Files may be \\
       &      & opened and closed several times during any run \\
       &      & to permit use of more than one file name.
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

A {\tt WRIT}e output is reinput using the {\tt READ} command
which has nearly identical options for {\tt xxxx}.
