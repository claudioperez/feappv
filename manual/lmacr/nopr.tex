\headb

The use of the {\tt NOPR}int command will discontinue
most output of commands.  Plot results and element
outputs will normally still be reported.  The use of {\tt PRIN}t
will cause the output of execution descriptions to
again be reported.  The default value is {\tt PRIN}t at start of
command language program execution.
