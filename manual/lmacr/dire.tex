The {\tt DIRE}ct command sets the mode of solution to direct
for the linear algebraic
equations generated by a {\tt TANG}ent or a {\tt UTAN}gent command.  The 
direct solution is performed using a variant of Gauss elimination.
The direct command requires the tangent matrix to fit
within the blank common array dimensioned in the main program (see
\textsl{FEAP}
Programmer Manual for procedures to reset the size of the blank common array).
In the interactive mode of solution a warning will be issued and control
returned to the user to permit a selection of an alternate method of solution.

An option exists to solve the equations for some problems using an iterative
method (see, the {\tt ITER}ative command language manual page).
