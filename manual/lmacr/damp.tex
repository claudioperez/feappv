\headb

The command {\tt DAMP}ing is used to compute a {\it damping}
matrix.  Each element computes a contribution to the damping
in the array {\tt S} when {\tt isw} is 9.
The standard version of {\sl FEAPpv} does not use the damping matrix.  In the
past user modified
versions have included damping matrices it to compute the complex modes
and frequencies of
non-proportionally damped systems.
