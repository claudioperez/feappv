The command {\tt MASS} is used to compute a consistent
or a diagonal {\it mass} matrix.  Each element
computes a contribution to both the consistent mass
diagonal mass.
The global mass to assemble is controlled by the parameter on the {\tt MASS}
command, with {\tt LUMP} producing a diagonal mass and any option the
consistent mass.

A consistent mass or a lumped (diagonal) mass 
may be used for eigencomputations (see command
{\tt SUBS}pace).  Both may also be used for transient solutions computed
using the explicit method (see command
{\tt TRAN}sient,{\tt EXPL}icit). They are not needed for other time integration
methods.
