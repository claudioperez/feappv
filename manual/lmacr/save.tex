The {\tt SAVE} command may be used to save the
current solution state and history data for use as a restart
file.  In the solution of complicated nonlinear problems
where difficulties are expected in achieving convergence
(e.g., a solution step may produce an overflow which terminates
exectution) a restart state may be saved on the disk
for each converged state.  The problem may then be initiated
from any of the saved states and continued.

The {\tt fileext} is optional and may be any 1-4
alphanumeric characters and is appended to the name of the
current restart save file which was named when the problem
was started if specified.  In interactive mode should a name
be given which already exists the user receives a prompt for
an alternate name or given the opportunity to write over the
old file.
