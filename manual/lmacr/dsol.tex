The command {\tt DSOLve} is used to specify when the
equations generated by a {\tt FORM} are to be solved.  In {\sl FEAP},
a solution of the equations is performed using a diagonal (lumped)
mass for the equations
\begin{displaymath}
\B{M} \, d\B{u} = \B{R}
\end{displaymath}
where $\B{M}$ is the diagonal mass and $\B{R}$ the residual.

The command must be proceded by a \texttt{MASS LUMP} and a \texttt{FORM}
command.
