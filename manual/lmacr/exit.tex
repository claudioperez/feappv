\headb

The last interactive command must be {\tt EXIT}  or
{\tt QUIT} (they may also be abreviated as {\tt E} or {\tt Q}.
This terminates the command language execution and returns the
program to perform additional
tasks on the same data, change the data, enter a new problem, or
{\tt STOP} execution.  The use of {\tt EXIT} causes a restart file
to be updated for subsequent resumptions of execution with
the current status preserved.

For interactive execution, using {\tt INTE}ractive, any additional
data will be requested as needed.
