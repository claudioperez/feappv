This option performs optimization of the ordering of unknowns for the
direct profile equation solver.  For optimization of the current system,
the command \texttt{OPTImize} is given alone.  To return to the default
ordering obtained from the mesh input order the command is given as
\texttt{OPTImize,OFF}.
