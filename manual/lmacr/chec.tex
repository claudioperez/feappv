The {\tt CHEC}k command requests a check of the mesh
consistency.  It is necessary for elements to have checking
capability for the {\tt isw = 2} option in order for {\tt CHEC}k to
report results.  Typical tests include jacobian tests at
nodes, tests on node sequencing, etc.

If the jacobian is negative at all nodes the nodal sequencing has been
in put in reverse order and should be resequenced.  The 4-node solid
elements contained in {\sl FEAPpv} will attempt the resequencing automatically;
however, the error is not corrected in the data input file so that it is
necessary to use the check command each time the problem is executed.
