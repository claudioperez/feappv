The use of the {\tt EIGE}lement command permits the computation
of the eigenvalues associated with the last computed
element tangent array.  It is assumed that the array is symmetric
and has real eigenvalues.  This option is useful during
element development to study the spectral properties of
the element, including number of zero eigenvalues or those
associated with some paratmeter.  Use of {\tt EIGE,VECT} reports
both the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the last element.
