The solution algorithm used by {\sl FEAPpv} to solve problems
is defined by a {\it command language program}.  The command language
program may be executed in either a {\it batch} or an {\it interactive}
mode using the initial command {\tt BATC}h or {\tt INTE}ractive,
respectively.  By properly
specifying the commands following either of these modes,
a very wide range of applications
may be addressed -- including both linear and non-linear,
as well as, steady state and transient applications.

The name for the command {\tt xxxx} is selected from the list contained
in the following pages of this appendix. The description for the options for
{\tt yyyy} and {\tt v1}, {\tt v2}, {\tt v3}
also may be obtained from the manual entry for each command.
