The {\tt ELSE} command may be used with a matching pair of
{\tt IF-ENDI}f commands.
The {\tt expression} is optional and
is used to control the actions taken during the
solution.
If the expression is absent the commands between the {\tt ELSE} and
{\tt ENDI}f are executed.
If the expression evaluates to be positive then the commands
contained between the {\tt IF} and the {\tt ELSE} or {\tt ENDI} are 
executed, otherwise solution continues with a check of the next {\tt ELSE}
For example, the sequence
\begin{verbatim}
        ...
       IF  10-a
         tang,,1
         param a 0
       ELSE b
         pause
       ELSE
         form
         solv
       ENDIf
       param a = a+1
        ...
\end{verbatim}
would compute a tangent, residual, and solution increment if {\tt 10-a}
is positive; otherwise the solution increment is computed using a
previous tangent.
