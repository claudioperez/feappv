\headb

The use of the {\tt HELP} command will produce a list of the
currently implemented commands at the current manual level.
The manual level is set by the command {\tt MANU}\-al, n where $n$ is
an integer between 0 and 3. The help feature is useful
only in an interactive mode of solution.  If
additional information is required for a specific command it
is necessary for the user to consult the users manual.
