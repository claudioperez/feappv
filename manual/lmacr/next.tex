The {\tt NEXT} command {\tt must} be used in conjunction
with a {\tt LOOP} command.

A {\tt LOOP-NEXT} pair is used to
repeat the execution of a set of commands.  The {\tt LOOP}
appears first, followed by one or more commands then
a {\tt NEXT} command.  The loop-next commands may be
nested to a depth of 8.  That is,
\begin{verbatim}
       LOOP,level-1,n1
         LOOP,level-2,n1
           LOOP,level-3,n1
              etc. to 8-levels
           NEXT
         NEXT
       NEXT
\end{verbatim}
is permitted.
If desired, the {\tt xxxx} may be used (as above)
to describe the type of next which is being closed, i.e.,
{\tt NEXT,time} would indicate the end of a time loop.

During interactive executions, {\tt LOOP-NEXT} commands
are not executed until the {\tt NEXT} command is input.
In this way a set of statements may be grouped and executed together.
