\label{mloop}

Many models for problems analyzed by finite element methods have mesh parts
which are similar except for stretching and rotation transformations.
\textsl{FEAPpv} provides input capabilities to generate the model using
\texttt{LOOP}-\texttt{NEXT} commands.  The basic input structure is given
by the command sequence
\begin{verbatim}
       LOOP,n
         ...
       NEXT
\end{verbatim}
where $n$ defines the number of times to repeat the commands contained
within the loop.  The value of $n$ may be a constant or a parameter.
Any standard \textsl{FEAPpv} mesh commands may be used between the \texttt{LOOP}
and \texttt{NEXT} statements, however, it is easiest to use commands which do
not require explicit definitions for node or element numbers.

\begin{figure}[hb!]

\caption{Two blocks using \texttt{LOOP-NEXT} commands}
\label{floop.0}
\end{figure}
A simple example is the repetition of two blocks of identical elements
in which the material number is different.  Assume first that a file
named \texttt{Imblock} is constructed which contains the commands
\begin{verbatim}
       BLOCk
         CART n1 n2 0 0 ma
           1   0  0
           2   a  0
           3   a  b
           4   0  b

       PARAMeter
          ma = ma + 1

\end{verbatim}
Then a second file is given which defines the initial values of parameters
and the looping control.  This file is given by the statements shown in
Table \ref{tloop.1}
where we note the use of the loop using the \texttt{TRANsform} command. 
\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
       FEAPpv * * Two block problem
         0  0  0  2  2  4
       PARAmeters
         a  = 5
         b  = 4
         n1 = 6
         n2 = 3
         ma = 1
 
       LOOP,2
         INCLude Imblock
         TRANsform
           1 0 0
           0 1 0
           0 0 1
           a 0 0
       NEXT
       MATE 1
         SOLID
           ELAStic ISOTropic 1000 0.25

       MATE 2
         SOLID
           ELAStic ISOTropic 2000 0.25

       END
\end{verbatim}

\label{tloop.1}
\end{center}
\end{table}
The above example produces the mesh shown in Fig. \ref{floop.0} and
is trivial (also not much is gained over a construction
using two block commands directly).

\end{figure}
A more involved example is shown 
in Fig. \ref{floop.1} for a disk containing circular holes.  This
example was constructed using the commands shown in Table \ref{tloop.2}.
\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
       LOOP 5
         TRANSform
           cosd(th)  sind(th)    0
          -sind(th)  cosd(th)    0
               0         0       1
               0         0       0
         INCLude Iwseg
         TRANSform
           cosd(th)  sind(th)    0
           sind(th) -cosd(th)    0
               0         0       1
               0         0       0
         INCLude Iwseg
         PARAmeter
           th = th + 72

       NEXT
\end{verbatim}
\caption{\texttt{LOOP-NEXT} disk mesh construction}
\label{tloop.2}
\end{center}
\end{table}
The file \texttt{Iwseg} contains the mesh for one part of the repeating
mesh as shown in Fig. \ref{floop.2}.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centerline {\hfil \includegraphics[height=2.0in]{figs/wheelsg} \hfil}

Many more involved meshe constructs may be considered using the
\texttt{LOOP}-\texttt{NEXT} commands.
