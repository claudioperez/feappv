{END AND MISCELLANEOUS BASIC MESH COMMANDS}
\label{end}

The above set of commands are part of the basic mesh input commands
available in {\sl FEAPpv} to generate a mesh.  The basic set
also include the commands {\tt PRINt} and {\tt NOPRint} which turn on
and off, respectively, the writing of data to the {\sl FEAPpv} output data file.
Once a mesh has been generated and checked it is usually not necessary to
continue writing the input data to the output file.  For large problems
the writing not only generates large disk files but also requires
additional processing time.

The final data item for the specification of the mesh data is the {\tt END}
command.  Once this command is issued {\sl FEAPpv} stops processing mesh
input commands, may generate missing data,
and looks for commands to manipulate the mesh or to solve
a problem using a {\tt BATCh} or {\tt INTEractive} method of processing
data.  The options to manipulate the mesh are described in Chapter \ref{manip}
and procedures to solve and plot results are presented
in Chapters \ref{command} and \ref{plot}, respectively.
