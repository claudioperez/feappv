\section{Regions and Element Groups}
\label{regions}

The elements in {\sl FEAPpv} may be assigned to different groups using the
{\tt REGI}\-on command.  The command is given as
\begin{verbatim}
       REGIon,number
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt number} is an integer constant of parameter defining the group
number for the elements.
Any elements which are input after a region command is given belong
to the given group number.
By default all elements are assigned to region zero.

The use of regions facilitates
merging groups of elements whose nodes should be common
but have different numbers (e.g., those defined using {\tt BLOC}k commands).
An illustration of this option is used in Example 4 above.
