\section{INCLude and LOOPing: Data reuse}
\label{subst}

Often in constructing a model it is possible to replicate one part to produce
a new part of the mesh.  \textsl{FEAP} provides several options to facilitate
such reuse.  The basic method is to place the part of the problem to be
reused in a separate file, called an include file, and to input the data by
adding a statement \texttt{INCLude filename} where the data is to be
inserted.  This feature is described in the next section.  A second option
is to mark the data using a \texttt{SAVE} command and to \texttt{READ} the
data where it is again needed.  This is described in Section \ref{save}.
Finally, it is possible to reread the data parts several times using a
\texttt{LOOP-NEXT} option as described in Section \ref{mloop}.

\subsection{Include Commands in Mesh Input}

Any data input records may be placed in a separate file and read using
the {\tt INCLude} command.  The form for the include is a single record
\begin{verbatim}
       INCLude,filename
\end{verbatim}
where {\tt filename} is the name of the file containing the input data.
This command may be used at any time and include files may call other
include files (to a maximum level of 9).  Thus, if the nodal coordinates
are created by another program and written to a file named {\tt Blockxy}
{\footnote{Upper and lower case letters are treated as different on 
some computer systems.}},
they may be input as {\sl FEAPpv} data using:
\begin{verbatim}
       COORdinates
       INCLude,Blockxy
                          ! blank termination record
\end{verbatim}
The information in each file must always be in the format required by
{\sl FEAPpv}.
If another format is written, then it is necessary to either translate the
data to the correct form or to write and link a user routine which can
input the data.
The creation of user routines is discussed in the {\sl FEAP Programmers
Manual}\scite{feapp}.

\subsection{READ and SAVE Commands in Mesh Input}
\label{save}

A group of mesh input statements also may be retained for future use by
placing them between the statements
\begin{verbatim}
       SAVE,filename
       .....
       .....
       SAVE,END
\end{verbatim}
{\tt filename} may be any 1 to 15 alphanumerical characters. Thus if
a {\tt SAVE MSH1} is used a new file named {\tt MSH1} will be
created to store the mesh commands to be saved.

For example, the following option may be used to generate nodal
forces with a variation in a load parameter.
\begin{verbatim}
       PARAmeter
         a= 5.
                       ! end with blank record
       SAVE,msh1       ! may also be SAVE,mes1
       PARAmete
         b= a/2
                       ! end with blank record
       FORCe
         31,0,b
         32,1,a
         34,0,a
         35,0,b
                       ! end with blank record
       SAVE,END
\end{verbatim}
A different loading state may then be specified by:
\begin{verbatim}
       PARAmeter
         a= -4.
                       ! terminator
       READ,msh1
\end{verbatim}
The value of $b$ will be recomputed using the new value of $a$
and the nodal forces will then be recomputed.  Many options are
possible using the features of parameters, expressions, INCLude, and SAVE
and READ commands.


\subsection{LOOP-NEXT to replicate mesh parts}
\label{mloop}
\index{Mesh command!LOOP}
\index{Mesh command!NEXT}
\index{Looping input}

Many models for problems analyzed by finite element methods have mesh parts
which are similar except for stretching and rotation transformations.
\textsl{FEAP} provides input capabilities to generate the model using
\texttt{LOOP}-\texttt{NEXT} commands.  The basic input structure is given
by the command sequence
\begin{verbatim}
       LOOP,n
         ...
       NEXT
\end{verbatim}
where $n$ defines the number of times to repeat the commands contained
within the loop.  The value of $n$ may be a constant or a parameter.
Any standard \textsl{FEAP} mesh commands may be used between the \texttt{LOOP}
and \texttt{NEXT} statements, however, it is easiest to use commands which do
not require explicit definitions for node or element numbers.

\begin{figure}[hb!]
\centerline {\hfil \includegraphics[height=2.2in]{figs/lp2blk} \hfil}
\caption{Two blocks using \texttt{LOOP-NEXT} commands \label{floop0}}
\end{figure}
A simple example is the repetition of two blocks of identical elements
in which the material number is different.  Assume first that a file
named \texttt{Imblock} is constructed which contains the commands
\begin{verbatim}
       BLOCk
         CART n1 n2 0 0 ma
           1   0  0
           2   a  0
           3   a  b
           4   0  b

       PARAMeter
          ma = ma + 1

\end{verbatim}
Then a second file is given which defines the initial values of parameters
and the looping control.  This file is given by the statements shown in
Table \ref{tloop.1}
where we note the use of the loop using the \texttt{TRANsform} command.
\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
       FEAP * * Two block problem
         0  0  0  2  2  4
       PARAmeters
         a  = 5
         b  = 4
         n1 = 6
         n2 = 3
         ma = 1
 
       LOOP,2
         INCLude Imblock
         TRANsform
           1 0 0
           0 1 0
           0 0 1
           a 0 0
       NEXT
       MATE 1
         SOLID
           ELAStic ISOTropic 1000 0.25

       MATE 2
         SOLID
           ELAStic ISOTropic 2000 0.25

       END
\end{verbatim}
\caption{\texttt{LOOP-NEXT} mesh construction \label{tloop.1}}
\end{center}
\end{table}
The above example produces the mesh shown in Fig. \ref{floop0} and
is trivial (also not much is gained over a construction
using two block commands directly).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centerline {\hfil \includegraphics[height=3.5in]{figs/wheel5} \hfil}
\caption{Disk with holes \label{floop1}}
\end{figure}
A more involved example is shown
in Fig. \ref{floop1} for a disk containing circular holes.  This
example was constructed using the commands shown in Table \ref{tloop.2}.
\begin{table}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\begin{verbatim}
       LOOP 5
         TRANSform
           cosd(th)  sind(th)    0
          -sind(th)  cosd(th)    0
               0         0       1
               0         0       0
         INCLude Iwseg
         TRANSform
           cosd(th)  sind(th)    0
           sind(th) -cosd(th)    0
               0         0       1
               0         0       0
         INCLude Iwseg
         PARAmeter
           th = th + 72

       NEXT
\end{verbatim}
\caption{\texttt{LOOP-NEXT} disk mesh construction \label{tloop.2}}
\end{center}
\end{table}
The file \texttt{Iwseg} contains the mesh for one part of the repeating
mesh as shown in Fig. \ref{floop2}.
\begin{figure}[ht!]
\centerline {\hfil \includegraphics[height=2.0in]{figs/wheelsg} \hfil}
\caption{Mesh segment for disk with holes \label{floop2}}
\end{figure}

Many more involved mesh constructs may be considered using the
\texttt{LOOP}-\texttt{NEXT} commands.  When using this option with blending
functions, however, \textit{do not} place \texttt{SNODe} or \texttt{SIDE}
commands within any looping instructions.  In this case a correct
structure is:
\begin{verbatim}
       SNODe
         1   ...
             etc.

       SIDE
         POLAr   ... (or other)
             etc.

       LOOP,n
         TRANsform coordinates
           ....

         BLENd
           .....
           etc.
       NEXT
\end{verbatim}
As a rule, any other commands which describes node or elements may
be placed within a \texttt{LOOP-NEXT} pair.
