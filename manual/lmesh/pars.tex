The {\tt PARS}e command may be used to enforce parsing
of the input data.  {\sl FEAPpv} data may be input in either direct
numerical form or in parameter or expression form.  In the
latter case the data must be parsed in order to compute the
value of the data entry.  When large amounts of data are to
be processed the program can be forced to ignore parsing
using the {\tt NOPA}rse command.  If subsequent data must be
parsed, a {\tt PARS}e command may be required to produce the
correct results.
