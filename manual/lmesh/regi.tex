The {\tt REGI}on command sets the current region
number to {\it nreg}.  The default value is 0.
Regions may be used to separate parts of the mesh for which use
of a {\tt TIE} command is to connect.  Alternatively, regions may
be used during execution to {\tt ACTI}vate or {\tt DEAC}tivate parts
of the mesh during execution.
