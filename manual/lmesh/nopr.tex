The use of the {\tt NOPR}int command will discontinue
placing information in the {\sl FEAPpv} output file
of most subsequent mesh data (material
data printed in each element will always be output).
The use of {\tt PRIN}t will cause
the mesh information to again be reported in the output file.  The
default value is {\tt PRIN}t at the start of each problem execution.
