Use of the {\tt RESE}t command will reinitialize all the
boundary condition codes to have no restraints imposed on
the degrees-of-freedom.  Thus, all the degrees-of-freedom
become unknowns for the problem.  The command is useful when
boundary conditions are to be changed from {\it displacement} to
{\it force} states during execution.
After the use of the {\tt RESE}t  command,  boundary
conditions for specified {\it displacement} conditions may
be reimposed using {\tt BOUN}dary, {\tt EBOU}dary, or {\tt CBOU}ndary
commands.
