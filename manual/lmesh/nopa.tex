The {\tt NOPA}rse command may be used to enforce no
parsing of the input data.  {\sl FEAPpv} data may be input in either
direct numerical form or in parameter or expression form.
In the former case the data need not be parsed in order to
compute the value of the data entry.  When large amounts of
data are to be processed the program can be forced to ignore
parsing using the {\tt NOPA}rse command and thus perform more efficiently.
If subsequent data must be parsed, a {\tt PARS}e command
may be required to produce the correct results.
