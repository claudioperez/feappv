The proportional loading number to be appled to nodal forces and displacments
may be input using this command.
The number may be set along
any set of nodes which has a constant value of the {\it i-coordinate
direction} (e.g., 1-direction (or x), 2-direction
(or  y),  etc.).  The data to be supplied during the definition of
the mesh consists of:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{r l}
\it i-coor   &-- Direction of coordinate (i.e., 1 = x, 2 = y, etc.) \\
\it xi-value &-- Value of i-direction coordinate to be used during  \\
             &\quad search (a tolerance of 1/1000 of mesh size is used  \\
             &\quad during search, any coordinate within the gap is  \\
             &\quad assumed to have the specified value).  \\
\it pnum(1,node) &-- Proportional load number of dof-1 \\
\it pnum(2,node) &-- Proportional load number of dof-2 \\
                 &\quad etc., to {\it ndf} directions \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
For nodes with sloping conditions, the degrees-of-freedom
are expressed with respect to the rotated frame 1-2 instead
of the global frame x1-x2 (x-y).  For three dimensional problem
the 3-direction coincides with the x3-direction (z).

Proportional load numbers may also be specified using the {\tt FPRO}p
and {\tt CPRO}p commands.  The data is order dependent with data
defined by {\tt FPRO}p processed first, {\tt EPRO}p processed second and
the {\tt CPRO}p data processed last.  The value defined last is used for
any analysis.
