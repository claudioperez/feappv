The use of the {\tt PRIN}t command will cause the description
of most information produced during the mesh description to be
placed in the {\sl FEAPpv} output file.  The use of {\tt NOPR}int will
discontinue the output of mesh information (except for data
printed in elements). The default value is {\tt PRIN}t.
