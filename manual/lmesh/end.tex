\heada{MESH}{END}
\hspace{1cm}{{end \hfill}}

The last mesh command must be {\tt END}.  This terminates
the mesh input and returns to the control program, which may
then perform additional tasks on the data or {\tt STOP} execution.

Immediately following the {\tt END} mesh command any additional
data required to manipulate the mesh (e.g., {\tt TIE}, {\tt LINK},
{\tt ELIN}k, {\tt PART}ition {\tt ORDE}r, {\tt RIGI}d and {\tt JOIN}t
should be given
prior to initiation of a problem solution using {\tt BATC}h and/or
{\tt INTE}ractive.
