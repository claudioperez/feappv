The {\tt BLOC}k data input segment is used to generate:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 2-node line elements in 1, 2, or 3-D.
\item 4 to 9-node quadrilateral elements in 2 or 3-D.
\item 3 or 6-node triangles in 2 or 3-D.  For the 3-node
elements alternative diagonal directions may be specified as indicated below.
\item 8-node hexahedra (bricks) in 3-D.
\item 4-node tetrahedra in 3-D.
\item Nodes only in 1, 2 or 3-D patches.
\end{enumerate}

The patch of nodes and triangular or quadrilateral elements
defined by {\tt BLOC}k is developed from a master
element which is defined by an isoparametric 4 to 9
node mapping function in terms of the two natural coordinates,
r (or $\xi_1$) and s (or $\xi_2$), respectively.
The node numbers on the master element of each
patch defined by {\tt BLOC}k are specified according to Figure \ref{blk2d}.
The four corner nodes of the master element must be
specified, the mid-point and central nodes are optional.
The spacing between the r-increments and s-increments
may be varied by an off-center placement of mid-side and
central nodes.  Thus, it is possible to concentrate
nodes and elements into one corner of the patch generated by
{\tt BLOC}k.  The mid-nodes must lie within the central-half of
the r-direction and the s-direction to keep the isoparametric mapping
single valued for all (r,s) points.
For a line patch, the nodes and 2 node elements are
defined from a 1-2 master linear line patch or a 1-3-2 master
quadratic line patch.  The {\it s-inc} parameter must be 0 for this option.
For a 3-D solid the patch is described by an 8 to 27-node
master solid element where the corner nodes are
required and mid-edge/side nodes are optional, as is the
center node (numbering for nodes is shown in Figures \ref{blk3da}, \ref{blk3db}
and \ref{blk3dc}).

The location of nodes on boundaries of adjacent patches should match
unless a contact problem is used to determine interactions between
bodies.
The {\tt TIE} command is used to merge adjacent patches.

When using the {\tt BLOC}k command one may enter zero for the
total number of nodes and elements on the {\tt FEAPpv} control
record.  {\tt BLOC}k will automatically generate the correct
number of nodes and elements.
If it is desired to use block to generate nodal coordinates only, the
value of {\it elmt1} should be entered as a negative number.
